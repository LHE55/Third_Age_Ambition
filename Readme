This is a Romhack of the game Nobunagas Ambition on the original Game Boy. To use it you need the US-Version of the ROM.
The Romhack changes all the generals to mostly famous, sometimes generic, LOTR-Generals. The world map and a lot of the wording is also changed to represent a Lord of the Ring Adventure.

Version 0.5

Changes:
- Map of Japan changed to Map of middle earth
- 12 new Realms (Misty Mountain, Erebor, Rivendell, Dale, Shire, Bree, Moria, Rhun, Lothlorien, Harad, Mirkwood, Dol Goldur, Gondor, Rohan, Isengard, Mordor)
- Every General name and sprite changed (100 Generals with 48 unique Sprites)
- Starting Conditions are changed compared to the original game

To Do:
- Making Bree Generals more Random in the stats
- FixingStability Problems
- Nicer Start Screen
- Some Texts
- Icons in battles are wrong


How to prepare the game:
- First you need to open the python file SRM.Py or the .exe-File and then put in your rom and make a version. Right now there is nothing random so making multiple seeds makes no difference.
- After that you can open the rom that gets generated in "Output" with any Game Boy Emulator.
